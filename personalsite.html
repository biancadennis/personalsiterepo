				My name is Bianca Dennis and I work at a social media analytics company in the financial district. Working with techies who build websites and write code that makes my job easier has inspired me to do the same. In February I began taking an part-time web development class at the New York Code + Design Academy and will be taking classes here for the next six months. 
			</p>
			<p>
				So how did I get here?
			</p>
			<p>
				In 2015 I graduated from Columbia University in the city of New York. I absolutely loved college. I was able to travel to Jordan in 2012 and to Spain in 2014: 
			</p>
			<p>
				I had a great time but ended up majoring in Middle East, South Asian, and African Studies with a minor in Latin American Cultures. I had taken great classes and wouldn't change anything about what I chose to Study but it's not a degree that's all that applicable to the real world. So here I am, wanting to move to a far away place (Seattle) and in need of skills that won't leave me homeless or in a job I hate.
			</p>
			<p>
				So take a look at what I have created so far! Iâ€™ll be updating the site with projects, blog posts and photos of my #TechLife journey. You can also follow me on Twitter and Instagram if you feel so inclined.

				Thanks for visiting!
